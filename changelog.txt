v1.1.0
	Complete overhaul due to substantial logic conflicts.
	Value still going up, and without having manual workarounds.
	
	Accomplishments:
	- Artaria is finished AGAIN.
	- Other locations information is still valid, but each location needs editing.
	- Added trackable "X Released".
	
	Upcoming:
	- Still need to reorder tracker icons into something which feels nice.
	- Trackable Silent Robe? This only "grants access" to upper Burenia without transport.
	- Lava Pumps being put in, but not yet used for tracking purposes. Toggle?
	
v0.2.0
	First major update, still not ready for public release.
	Happy to say the tracker is now more of a value than a hindrance.
	
	Finished:
	- All Artaria locations and logic. It's good to go.
	- All Burenia locations.
	- Most Cataris locations.
	- Most Dairon locations.
	- All Elun locations.
	- All Ferenia locations.
	- Some Ghavoran locations.
	- No Hanubia locations. RIP
	- Itorash is 100% done. Kappa
	
	Upcoming:
	- Item tracker icons for X, Silent Robe(?), right-click options for DNA on bosses.
	- Bosses should start lit up and darken when checked.
	- Continue plugging in all locations and logic.
	
	Not being worked on:
	- Lava Pumps/Power Stations/Blobs have all been completely neglected, probably forever.

v0.1.0:
	#Initial release
	- Considering proper implementation of lava pumps. Probably a toggle: either they're a check, or they're auto-checked.
	- Map tracker is priority.
	- No intention of making an auto-tracker.
	- Item tracker will come shortly after map tracker is complete.
